# ExtraQuestButton

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/extraquestbutton) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info23464).

## Description

ExtraQuestButton adds a button that will show the quest item for the closest quest with an item.  
It is basically the Extra*Action*Button of quests!

Since it's so similar to the Extra*Action*Button, it will use the same keybinding and style, and when you move/scale Extra*Quest*Button you'll move/scale the Extra*Action*Button too.

If both the Extra*Action*Button and the Extra*Quest*Button should show at the same time, the Extra*Action*Button will be preferred, and the transition between them looks something like this:
