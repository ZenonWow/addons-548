Bugger
=========

Bugger is a basic GUI front-end for !BugGrabber using the default UI's
error frame with some modifications.

It should currently be considered a rough beta.

Aside from the obvious features, you can shift-click the previous/next
buttons to jump to the first/last error from the selected session.

Features that exist in BugSack that will not be added to Bugger
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Automatic popup of the window when an error occurs.
* Sending errors to other players. I've never used this feature or
  known anyone who did.

  search feature, you're probably doing something wrong.

Feedback

Post a comment on WoWInterface, or submit a ticket on CurseForge. If
you are reporting a problem, be specific -- tell me which version of
the addon you're using, which servers you're on (live/beta), which
Broker display you're using, what steps I should follow to reproduce
the problem, whether it happens with other addons disabled, and the
full text of any related error messages.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send me a private message
on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
