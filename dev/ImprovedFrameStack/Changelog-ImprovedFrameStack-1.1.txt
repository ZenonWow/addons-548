Tagging as 1.1


--------------------

Andrew Scott:
	- Please, Mr. Packager, won't you be so kind and package my fucking tags?
	- Made a meaningless change since the CF packager has decided that it will not package my repo - Deciding to skip git repository: wow/improved-framestack/mainline, as not updated.
	- Added recursive searching for a child frame in a parent's tables to attempt to resolve things more consistently. The max depths of this search can be set in global variable IFS_MaxDepth, and defaults to 3.
	- Initial commit.
