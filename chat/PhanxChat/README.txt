^1: Note that the Alt key is still required with the up/down arrows to
    access previously entered chat lines, due to a Blizzard bug.

^2: “Sticky” means that the chat box remembers which channel you last typed
    into, instead of making you type “/g” or “/ra” again.

Usage
---------

* Type “/pchat” for options, or find them in the Interface Options.
* Type “/pchat clear” to clear all chat windows.
* Type “/tt” or “/wt” to send a whisper to your current target.
