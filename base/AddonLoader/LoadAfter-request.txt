I've used the search function but can't find an official topic for AddonLoader

I was curious about event loading, I have an AddOn that responds to the Auction House Opening and reacts upon it. I tried by using this:
X-LoadOn-Events: AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW

However this doesn't seem to call upon AnAddOn:AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW() once loaded.

So I tried adding:
## X-LoadOn-AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW: local loaded, reason = LoadAddOn("AnAddOn"); if (loaded) then AnAddOn:AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW(); end

It works fine and responds to the first Open aswell but it gave an error in the BugSack for AddonLoader instead.

Is there any way except checking in OnEnable if I may have missed the event I was after? Like a X-LoadAfter-AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW :)
