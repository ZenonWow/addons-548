Combat Mode
Adds a keybind toggle and smart mouselook locking to World of Warcraft.  This AddOn should not interfere with your current hotkey setup or configuration.

 

HELP WANTED:  I'd love to see some great videos of questing/pvp/raid/dungeon action using this AddOn, if you make a video up I'll feature it here. :)  Thanks Everyone!

 

This AddOn adds a Combat Mode feature to WoW.  It is intended emulate a missing official feature, while staying true to WoW functionality.

 

INSTRUCTIONS:  Install the AddOn and enter your Keybindings settings, you will find "Combat Mode" listed there.  Map the toggle key to a key of your choice to enable Combat Mode.  Pressing the Combat Mode hotkey will TOGGLE on and off.  When toggled off, your mouse buttons are remapped to what they were originally.  You may also use the HOLD keybind to enable or disable combat mode quickly.

 

 

 

 Features:

Handles Ground Targeting Skills (Releases cursor, returns after cast)
Handles Pet Casting / Move abilities (Releases cursor, returns after cast)
Mappable toggle and hold keys for Combat Mode
Mappable mouse clicks, shift and control clicks
Automatically releases the mouse cursor when specific frames are visible (Quest Text/Map/Bags etc) and returns to combat mode.   For example, you can open your bags, your mouse cursor is available and close them without having to re-enable Combat Mode.  This also works for questing.
Smart Targeting -- Mouse1 has two functions while in Combat Mode.  If you have a friendly NPC selected, you may click Mouse1 again to interact.  If you're not in range, you will be able to select another NPC with Mouse1.
Mouse1 and Mouse2 while in Combat mode have new functionality

DEFAULT CONTROLS

Mouse1 SMART TARGETING*: Target Nearest Friend / Interact Target
Mouse2: (Hold) Target Scan Enemy
Control+Click: Target Nearest Friend
Shift+Click: Target Previous Friend
KEYBINDING MOUSE CLICKS

 Simply type /cm or /combatmode or enter Interface Options -> Combat Mode

Do you have an option to use skill from Action Bar 1 on Left mouse?

In reply to xDark0ne:

 Yes, go into your Interface Options then Combat Mode.
There are options in there to remap the default keybinds, change your Mouse1 to ACTIONBAR1 through ACTIONBAR12, these are your hotbar slots :)
The Smart Targeting feature currently isn't an "option", I still have to code that feature in.  I'm going to make it so you can set SMART targeting on top of any binding.

Next addition i'm working on is "Smart Targeting" to replace the default left click, or to be remapped with a keybind.

Essentially it will:

No Target Selected
Scan for Enemy Target
No Enemy Target Found, Target Friendly
Enemy Targeted
Scan for Target Enemy (click for new target)
Friendly Targeted
If Friendly Target is within interact range, interact with target, otherwise Select Enemy Player Scan / Select Friendly if none found
The purpose of this is to allow left click to be used for multiple purposes while in Combat Mode.

 I actually ended up handling this slightly differently in 1.2.0.  Left click selects friendly by default, if you're within range, it will change to interact for you.  If you're out of range, it's back to select friendly.   Essentially allowing you to Mouse1 your way to victory while questing / talking to NPC's.

Keybindings can now be altered in Interface Options, a dropdown is set for each.  There are a few options I intend to add in there as well.

I had to update the Keybindings again, there were a lot of issues binding Target Friendly to a ctrl+click key, it doesn't have the same affect as putting it on a basic click.

 

SO, Left click now selects a friendly target, right click will select an enemy target.  Control or Shift click to interact.  Much simpler, I am still building the ui for the config, that's coming.

Hello, Awesome addition with the hold for cursor. Testing it I had found out that while in the transmog window it remains in combat mode until toggled off.

As for configuring mouse controls, there are two ways I can go about it.

Bind all shit+control clicks to the ActionBar so you can place your own abilities/macros, simply put the slash command in a macro and put it on your hotbar in the desired location
Use Ace3 and create a UI in the AddOn configuration for further tweaks and controls
Option 2 is a longer term goal of mine with the project to allow for further tweaks of the combat mode engine, however the flexibility and speed in which I could implement #1 is probably rather immediate.

I thought about it and most people already use the number keys or keybinds around their WASD to play, and are used to it.  Adding click to attack I don't think is what makes this AddOn interesting.  Being able to stay within Combat Mode and play the game, is.  This is more about the direction of the AddOn and it's purpose than trying to rebind everyone's control schemes.

 

Therefor I've altered the controls to be more simplified, right click will target enemies and control right click will target friendlies.  Left click will interact.  This is also in line with a few requests i've had to make it more similar to the GW2 feel of right clicking to select.

Hi, add pls GwCharacterWindows frame and GwCharacterWindowsMoverFrame, cause your addon doesnt automatically acticate the mouse when i open character window in addon GW2-ui (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gw2-ui)

And add pls option to change Control + Mouse1 -> Mouse2 for more GW2 experience :D

And is this possible to target dead enemies to interact for looting them?

And target NPCs to talk with them.

In reply to xDark0ne:

 If you use Shift + Mouse1 then Shift + Mouse2 you can target NPC's to speak with them.
I can't figure out a way to target and loot bodies, you still need to release your cursor for that either using the toggle or hold key.
I'm working on figuring out how to add change controls for the mouse, this is a feature I want to add.
Check out 1.0.7 once it's approved for GW2 UI support.
Thank you for the feedback :)

Thank you!  Haven't found anything else like this and it's really freshened up the combat for me.  I like the toggle to turn the mode on and off particularly.

I love this, so far It is amazing. So far I've come into 1 problem, and that is that it doesnt free my mouse since I use an addon called Immersion (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/immersion?gameCategorySlug=addons&amp;projectID=257550). I dont know how easy it would be to add support but I thought I should bring it to your attention. Have a great day!

 I am working on fixing this now, I would really like to have compatibility with it.  In the meantime you can press the Toggle key again to free your mouse.  I have an idea for a fix for Immersion.
