API GetFriendInfo
â†’ WoW API
Retrieves information about a person on your friends list.

name, level, class, area, connected, status, note = GetFriendInfo(friendIndex);
Parameters
Arguments
friendIndex 
Integer - Index of friend in the friend list (Note that status changes can re-order the friend list, indexes are not guaranteed to remain stable across events) (Also note that index should not be greater than 50 [see Notes]).
Returns
name 
String - Friend's name, or nil (if index is invalid)
level 
Integer - Friend's level, or 0 (if offline/invalid).
class 
String - Friend's class, or "Unknown" (if offline/invalid).
area 
String - Friend's current location, or "Unknown" (if offline/invalid).
connected 
Boolean - 1 if friend is online, nil otherwise.
status 
String - Friend's current status flags (AFK or DND).
note 
String - Friends note.
Example
This example is pre-2.4 and thus doesn't utilize the friend note.

local name, level, class, loc, connected, status = GetFriendInfo(1);
if (name) then
 DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("Your "..status.." friend "..name.." (The level "..level.." "..class..") is in "..loc..".");
else
 DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("You have no friends?!");
end
Result
Your <AFK> friend Bill (The level 99 Leprechaun) is in Neverland.

Notes
Friend information isn't necessarily automatically kept up to date. You can use the ShowFriends function to request an update from the server.


Do not use indexes greater than 50 (the maximum number of friend list entries)!

With some AddOns installed the client may crash after typing "/script GetFriendInfo(51)" (especially if FlagRSP is activated).

This crash leads to ERROR #132 (memory could not be "read").

Please use GetNumFriends() to iterate over all indexes securely.
