Regexes for code normalization. 1st line goes to  Find what:  2nd goes to  Replace with:

identifier= value  ->  identifier = value:    ([^\s~=])=  -> \1 = 
--
([^\s~=])=
\1=


Simple replaces:
--
_G -> GL    _ADDON -> ADDON    -- Then fix the initialization usually at the beginning of the file to reference the original global _G. Or getfenv(1) if you like, but that's more advanced and broken in Lua 5.2.
