General about hiding framesEdit
To hide a frame, you have to enter the frame name, followed by the command :Hide()

Example:

 MyFrame:Hide()
Hides a frame called "MyFrame".

If you use this in a Macro (not in an Addon), you have to add a /script-tag before:

/script MyFrame:Hide()

Show a hidden frameEdit
Addon:

 MyFrame:Show()
Macro:

/script MyFrame:Show()

NOTE: Most frames have event handlers so even if you hide it, it can pop back up as a result of an event handler calling it's Show function. To avoid this you need to prevent the frame from getting these events or from executing the code that makes the frame show. Most Blizzard's frames (if not all) use a single function to handle all events, which makes it easier for us. When hidding the frame you can make the OnEvent function point to nil so no function gets called:

 PlayerFrame:SetScript("OnEvent", nil);
 PlayerFrame:Hide();
And then restore the original function when you want to show the frame again:

 PlayerFrame:SetScript("OnEvent", PlayerFrame_OnEvent);
 PlayerFrame:Show();
You will have to go through the code for each frame to get the exact functions, and with some (like target or pet) do some checks before actually showing it, i.e. Make sure the unit exists.

In the following there are listed some frames you might want to hide:

Unit Frames Edit
Player Window Edit
The Player window in the upper left that is always shown for yourself is PlayerFrame.

  PlayerFrame:Hide()
Party Window Edit
The windows that are shown for group members are PartyMemberFrameX, where X = 1..4. All these can be hidden at once by the function HidePartyFrame(), provided by the default party frame lua code.

 HidePartyFrame() -- hides all party members
 PartyMemberFrameX:Hide() -- hides a specified party member (X=1/2/3/4)

 MinimapCluster:Hide()
