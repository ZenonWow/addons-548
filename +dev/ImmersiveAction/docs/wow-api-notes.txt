--
facing = GetPlayerFacing()
Returns the direction the player is facing in radians, in the [0, 2Ï€] range, where 0 is North and values increase counterclockwise.
Indicates the direction the player model is (normally) facing and in which the player will move if he begins walking forward; not the camera orientation.
Patch changes
Legion Patch 7.1.0 (2016-10-25): Returns nil while in a restricted area (instance/battleground/arena). 
Wrath of the Lich King Patch 3.1.0 (2009-04-14): Added. 





https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_GetUnitSpeed
--
Returns a value representing the moving speed of a unit. Added in Patch 3.0.1.

currentSpeed, runSpeed, flightSpeed, swimSpeed = GetUnitSpeed("unit");
Arguments
unit 
String (unitId) - Unit to query the speed of. This has not been tested with all units but does work for "player" units.
Returns
currentSpeed 
Number - current movement speed in yards per second (normal running: 7; an epic ground mount: 14)
runSpeed 
Number - the maximum speed on the ground, in yards per second (including talents such as Pursuit of Justice and ground mounts)
flightSpeed 
Number - the maximum speed while flying, in yards per second (the unit need to be on a flying mount to get the flying speed)
swimSpeed 
Number - the maximum speed while swimming, in yards per second (not tested but it should be as the flying mount)
Example
The following snippet prints your current movement speed in percent:

/script print(string.format("Current speed: %d%%", GetUnitSpeed("player") / 7 * 100))
Notes
As of 4.2, runSpeed, flightSpeed, swimSpeed returns were added. It seem you can also get target unit speed (not tested on the opposite faction).
A constant exists: "BASE_MOVEMENT_SPEED" which is equal to 7 (4.2).

There's a new event PLAYER_STARTED_MOVING (and PLAYER_STOPPED_MOVING) that covers all of those except jumping.
