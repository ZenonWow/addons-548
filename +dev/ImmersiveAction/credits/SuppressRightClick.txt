A tip is to allow right-double-click in combat to interact. If in dire need of interaction it's common to resort to click spam, which makes it work. This is the code I use in UrzUI:

RightClickUpdateDelay = 0;
WorldFrame:HookScript("OnMouseUp", function(self, button)
      if ( UnitAffectingCombat("player") and ( button == "RightButton" ) and ( RightClickUpdateDelay < GetTime() )) then
         RightClickUpdateDelay = GetTime()+0.3;
         MouselookStop();
      end
end);

Well, here's what possible:

(run both macros once, in this order)
/run local f=CreateFrame("button","mlook")f:RegisterForClicks("AnyDown","AnyUp")f:SetScript("OnClick",function(s,b,d)if d then MouselookStart()else MouselookStop()end end)SecureStateDriverManager:RegisterEvent("UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT")
/run local f=CreateFrame("frame",nil,nil,"SecureHandlerStateTemplate")RegisterStateDriver(f,"mov","[@mouseover,exists]1;0")f:SetAttribute("_onstate-mov","if newstate==1 then self:SetBindingClick(1,'BUTTON2','mlook')else self:ClearBindings()end")

If it's to your liking, it's not too much trouble to turn into an addon (and possibly add an option to toggle it off)

Bear in mind, you can't use right click to initiate auto attack or interact with npcs with this enabled, which I found quite frustrating. (I usually interact with the Interact w/ Mouseover bind anyways, which I've got bound on my mousewheel, so it's no problem for me)

There is an addon called SuppressRightClick which makes the default right click action available on double right click instead of blocking it completely:
http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/src
However, I did not like the behavior of this addon (in particular, it blocks right clicks only in combat, and therefore does not protect from accidental pulls), so I made a custom modification of that addon which always blocks single right clicks:
local DoubleClickDuration = 0.3;
local LastRightClick = 0;
WorldFrame:HookScript("OnMouseUp", function(self, button)
	if (not (MouselookHandler and MouselookHandler.shouldMouselook) and
			button == "RightButton" and
			LastRightClick + DoubleClickDuration < GetTime()) then
		LastRightClick = GetTime();
		MouselookStop();
	end
end);

This code is also compatible with the MouselookHandler addon:
