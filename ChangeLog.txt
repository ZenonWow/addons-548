=== v4.1.352 ALPHA ===

** IMPORTANT: ** This is an ALPHA. Do NOT install this unless you know what you're doing. If you have any issues, please use the [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/masque/tickets|ticket system]].

** General **

* ButtonFacade has been renamed to 'Masque' and has been overhauled. It is backwards-compatible with ButtonFacade-enabled add-ons and includes a (temporary)  ButtonFacade 'add-on' that will preload Masque for those add-ons still using the old API. It will also attempt to import an add-on's skin settings the first time add-on registers itself with Masque if it's still using the ButtonFacade API.
* Masque's options are now load-on-demand. An option is available to preload them but is disabled by default.
* Add-ons and their groups can now be disabled. Disabling an add-on will disable its sub-groups, etc.
* Masque's slash commands are /msq and /masque.
* Masque now supports LibDualSpec.

** Button API **

* Add-ons no longer need to save skin settings. This is now handled by Masque.
* The following methods are available to the 'Button' API and function as they previously did:
** :Group('Addon', 'Group')
** :AddSkin('SkinID', {SkinData})
** :GetNormalTexture({Button})
** :GetBackdropLayer({Button})
** :GetGlossLayer({Button})
** All other methods have been deprecated and are in a temporary state until add-on authors update to the new API.
* The following methods are available to the button 'Group' API and function as they previously did:
** :AddButton({Button} [, {ButtonData})
** :RemoveButton({Button})
** :Delete()
** :ReSkin()
** :GetLayer({Button}, 'Layer') NEW - Returns the specified layer for the button passed.
** :GetLayerColor('Layer')
** All other methods have been either deprecated or are intended for internal use only.
* To prevent excessive overhead, a button's layers (ButtonData) are no longer parsed when the button is skinned but rather when the button is added to a group.

** Button Skins **

* Button skins can now use a random texture for the 'Normal' layer. To enable this feature, set the 'Normal.Random' variable to true and place the list of textures in an indexed table assigned to the 'Normal.Textures' variable. This requires at least 2 entries. (Elloria, WoW Interface)
* Added the 'Duration' text layer for buff/debuff buttons.
* Button skin elements no longer support a 'Scale' attribute. Use 'Width' and 'Height'.
* Button 'Icon' layers no longer support a 'BlendMode' attribute.
* Button skins can no longer hide text layers.
* Button text layers now accept the following attributes:
** FontSize (Number)
** JustifyH ("LEFT", "CENTER", "RIGHT")
** JustifyV ("TOP", "MIDDLE", "BOTTOM")
** Note: These settings require that the 'Masque_Version' be set or the old methods of alignment will apply.
* The LBF_Version entry has been replaced with Masque_Version. The current version is 40100.
* Skins now support a 'Shape' parameter that, in a future build, will allow the spell alert animation to fit the button style. At this time, only "Square" and "Circle" are supported. If not specified, this defaults to "Square".
* Skins now support the 'Version' (number) and 'Author' (string) keys. A future version of Masque *may* include a 'skin info' panel that will display this information.
* Skins no longer have to specify the 'Normal' layer as being 'Static'. Instead, this is now the default behavior. If a skin author *really* wants to use the built-in state changes, they can force this by explicitly setting the 'Static' attribute to false.
* Skins can now use the 'EmptyTexture' and 'EmptyCoords' attributes for the 'Normal' layer even if not using the default state changes.

** Known Issues **

* A lot of add-ons and skins will need to be updated. Be patient.
