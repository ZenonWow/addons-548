Shipping the next batch of phasing and Aldor/Scryers updates. This should make things even more clear.


--------------------

Vlad:
	- Added Blasted Lands phase indication for Horde.
	- Added Aldor/Scryers support. The icons appear appropriately and will also have a helpful icon in Shattrath regarding how to pick a side, thus gaining access to more candy!
