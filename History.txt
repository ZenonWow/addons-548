Release History

3.3.327

- LibButtonFacade:
  - Border color support is now available.
    - The Group:AddButton() method now how has a third parameter, "Type". This new string parameter will allow authors to specify the type of button that's being passed so that the borders may be colored correctly. These types are:
      - "None" (Unremovable Debuff)(Red)
      - "Curse" (Purple)
      - "Disease" (Brown)
      - "Magic" (Light Blue)
      - "Poison" (Light Green)
      - "Action" (Default)(Green)
      - "Enchant" (Purple)
      - "Special" (A special type that allows for custom coloring.)(Blue)
  - The Group:AddButton() method will now throw an error if a button object is not passed as the first parameter.
  - The Group:AddButton() method will now correctly return if attempting to add a button to a group that already has that button assigned to it.
  - A new Group method, :SetButtonType(Button,Type) is available. This will update the button's type and reskin it on the fly.
  - A new method, LBF:SetBorderColor(Button,r,g,b,a) is available. This will override the color of the border but requires the button's type to be set to "Special". Note that this method will NOT update the options window.
  - The Group:Skin() method now only supports a table of the layers and their respective colors. The single layer specification used by the ButtonFacade GUI has been removed.
  - The Group:SetLayerColor() method used by the ButtonFacade GUI will now correctly update the skin with new color.
  - A button's additional frame layers will now automatically update their levels when Button:SetFrameLevel() is called.
  - Removed the redundant code for SetTextColor() since SetTextColor works like it should.
  - Removed the out-dated hooks for SetVertexColor since it apparently works correctly.
  - More code optimization. (Scope: It's not just for bad breath.)
- Skin API
  - The "Border" layer no longer supports the "Color" attribute. Instead, a new attribute, "Colors", is available that allows the skin author to specify a border color for each type of button. (See the notes above on button types)
- ButtonFacade GUI:
  - The ButtonFacade GUI has been reworked a little and tool tips should now be slight more descriptive.
  - Layers that are disabled in the skin definition will now show their respective options as disabled in the GUI.
- Miscellaneous:
  - ButtonFacade will no longer be registered in the global namespace. Authors will have to use AceAddOn or IsAddOnLoaded() to check for it.
  - Removed AceLocale.

3.1.255

ButtonFacade GUI:
- ButtonFacade will now attempt to remember the global skin settings. To be clear, it will only remember the *global* setting. It is still up to add-on authors to save the skin settings for their own add-on's root group.
- Due to the GUI saving the settings and additional modules, the profile selection panel has been enabled once again.
- Tons of GUI tweaks and added some missing features (tool tips, etc), so the localizations will need to be updated.

LibButtonFacade:
- The "root" group is now called "ButtonFacade" instead of an empty string.
- The separator for RegIDs is now an underscore instead of a "pipe". Additionally, all root addon groups will have a RegID matching the name that they're registered with. IE, instead of Bartender4 having a RegID of "|Bartender4", it will have a RegID of "Bartender4". All subgroups will have RegIDs that follow the "Addon_Group_Button" format.
- The skin callback firing function will now return the addon's root group data if a group is not specified. This means that addon authors can call LBF:Group("Addon"):Skin(self.db.profile["Addon"].SkinID, ...) prior to calling it for their individual groups to ensure that ButtonFacade's GUI displays the current settings for the addon's root group correctly. Feel free to contact me if you're unsure how to implement this correctly or if it gives you problems/errors.
- Any author attempting to write a LBF GUI will need to register their addon with LBF via the skin callback function. The addon *MUST* be registered as "ButtonFacade".

Miscellaneous:
- Added WoWI's minion tag.
